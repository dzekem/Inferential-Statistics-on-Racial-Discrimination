# Inferential Statistics on Racial Discrimination

Inferential statistics is implemented in this project to see if race has an infleunce in the US job offer. Here the null hypothesis states that there is a relationship between race and call for a job offer. While the alternative hypothes-is states that there is no relationship between race and call for a job offer. 
Considering the Z test, calculating mean of boostrap replicates and standard deviation from which the P value is calculated. The P value = 0.494 which is < 0.5. This therefore means we fail to reject the alternative hypothesis and then the null hypothesis is rejected. 

From this hypothesis test, it shows that there is no relationship between race and being called for a job.

## Conclussion

To be called for a job in Us does not have any relationship with race. This is instead based on the individual competence which defines who is most suitable for the job offer. 
Inferential statistics has therefore been used to determine if there is any relationship between a feature(race) and the target(being called for a job.
